# Two steps forward, one step back

title: Two steps forward, one step back: A story of a reluctant open data science transformation in lakes research

author: Jeff Hollister, US EPA, Office of Research and Development, Atlantic Ecology Division (soon to be Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division)

This repository holds the materials for a talk I originally gave to the USGS Wisconsin Water Science Center.  The story this talk tells is of progress towards open data science, told through case studies of limnology and cyanobacteria research, in an organization that embraces new technology and approaches reluctantly.  To be clear the story is one of progress, but progress through obstinence, some rule breaking, and support from key players in the organization.  It is a documentary of our experiences, not a how-to!
