title: Two steps forward, one step back: A reluctant open science transformation in lakes research

This repository holds the materials for a talk I originally gave to the USGS Wisconsin Water Science Center.  The story this talk tells is of progress towards open science, told through case studies of limnology and cyanobacteria research, in an organization that embraces new technology and approaches reluctantly.  To be clear the story is one of progress, but progress through obstinence, some rule breaking, and support from key players in the organization.  It is a documentary of our experiences, not a how-to!
