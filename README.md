title: Two steps forward, one step back: A story of a reluctant open data science transformation in lakes research


author: Jeff Hollister, US EPA, Office of Research and Development, Atlantic Ecology Division (soon to be Atlantic Coastal Environmental Sciences Division)

This repository holds the materials for a talk I originally gave to the USGS Wisconsin Water Science Center.  The story this talk tells is of progress towards open data science, told through case studies of limnology and cyanobacteria research, in an organization that embraces new technology and approaches reluctantly.  To be clear the story is one of progress, but progress through obstinence, some rule breaking, and support from key players in the organization.  It is a documentary of our experiences, not a how-to!

## STICS Impact Statement
Open science is a way of conducting science that has all components of the scientific process open and available to all, including data, papers, and even the information technology resources used. This is important because it allows other to access our research, build on that work, and reproduce our findings.  However, in strictly controlled federal information technology workspaces using many of the open science tools can be challenging.  In this presentation, I discuss several open science tools, their implementation in lakes research at a USEPA ecological research facility, the problems we encountered using these novel tools in a federal information technology workspace and how we have worked to overcome these problems.  The results of our efforts are important as they are a demonstration that open science tools are compatible with the rules and regulations governing software, code, and data in the federal government, they provide examples for other federal agencies attempting to implement open science approaches, and they show that perseverance and collaboration across the agency does in fact move our scientific practice forward.
