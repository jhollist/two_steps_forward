## The story

- Lakes and cyanobacteria
- Computational approaches
- Open data science tools 

![funct](figure/cyano_model_function.jpg)

## Two steps forward: R

- In use for a long time
- Growth in users
- Installs originally *ad hoc*

## One step back: R

- People complained that R was bad because it didn't work
- Installs in a tightly controlled Federal IT environment

## Progress: R

- We developed a standardized installation approach 
- Still have problems...

## Two steps forward: GitHub

- In ~2010, GitHub made available to USEPA
- 167 repositories
- 623 members in the USEPA Org
- 177 members who have committed to a reposiorty

## One step back: GitHub 

- !Collaboration
- Pricing problem with GitHub Organization 
  - Grandfathered Org: pay for private repositories
  - We are are out 

## Progress: GitHub

- Change to guidance, we can now use a collaboration platform to collaborate!
- Pricing issue still a work in progress
  - Discussions about using multiple Orgs
  - Enterprise GitHub
  - Bitbucket...

## Two steps forward: Pre-prints and post-publication review

- Microcystin and Chlorophyll *a*
- Modelling Trophic State

## One step back: Pre-prints and post-publication review

- General brain explosions...
- Many emails
- Much angst

## Progress: Pre-prints and post-publication review

- Separate briefing
- An interim policy resulted to allow our use of journals that use post-publication review

## Two steps forward: Code review

- `lakemorpho`
- `elevatr`

## One step back: Code review

- First attempt failed (see GitHub One step back)
- Lack of internal review mechanism
- Did review anyway, but no consistent mechanism

## Progress: Code review

- New GitHub collaborator policy
- Draft Scientific Software Clearance policy
- With ORD Senior Managers

## Two steps forward: Licensing

- Creative Commons Zero Approved in 2015
- Federal Source Code Policy promised guidance as well

## One step back: Licensing

- But...  CC0 isn't OSI approved
- Guidance never came
- Prevented use of Journal of Open Source Software 

## Progress:  Licensing

- As of ... we have approval to use MIT, GPL, Apache
- Other licenses are under review

## Two steps forward: Shiny

- Broad demand for Shiny applications
- Many Shiny developers across the Agency
- Got

## One step back: Shiny

- Multiple steps back but at different time and for different reasons
- Purchase of Enterprise Shiny server took forever
- Set up of server took forever
- Process to add and troubleshoot apps took forever (still a WIP)
- Just internal to EPA
- cloud.gov not a traditional server set up

## Progress: Shiny

- Very, very close to first ATO'd, official public EPA shiny app on shiny.epa.gov
- Making progress on other fronts for Shiny (e.g. EPA AWS Platform)

## Unorganized parting thoughts

- This is a documentary, not a how-to
- Much of this progress required a bit of subversion (doing things we weren't supposed to do)
